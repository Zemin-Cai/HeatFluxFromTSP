# Heat Flux Calculation from Temperature Sensitive Coating

This repository contains the programs to calculate heat flux fields from time history of the surface temperature measured using TSP by solving the inverse heat transfer problem for the two-layer structure. The exact analytical inverse heat transfer solution of the one-dimensional heat conduction equation for a polymer layer (TSP) on a semi-infinite base and a finite base was obtained under the assumption that the thermal properties are constants. The analytical inverse heat transfer method has been used to calculate the heat flux fields in temperature-sensitive-paint measurements. The numerical inverse heat transfer method (referred to as the numerical method hereafter) has been developed for the two-layer structures with the temperature-dependent thermal properties of the materials. This Matlab toolbox contains the programs and functions developed in references.
